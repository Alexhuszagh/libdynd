The DyND ND::Array
==================

The DyND nd::array is a multidimensional data storage container, inspired
by the NumPy ndarray and based on the Blaze datashape system. Like NumPy,
it supports strided multidimensional arrays of data with a uniform
data type, but has the ability to store ragged arrays and data types
with variable-sized data.
