/*
 * Parses (almost) standard ISO 8601 date strings. The differences are:
 *
 * + The date "20100312" is parsed as the year 20100312, not as
 *   equivalent to "2010-03-12". The '-' in the dates are not optional.
 * + Only seconds may have a decimal point, with up to 18 digits after it
 *   (maximum attoseconds precision).
 * + Either a 'T' as in ISO 8601 or a ' ' may be used to separate
 *   the date and the time. Both are treated equivalently.
 * + Doesn't (yet) handle the "YYYY-DDD" or "YYYY-Www" formats.
 * + Doesn't handle leap seconds (seconds value has 60 in these cases).
 * + Doesn't handle 24:00:00 as synonym for midnight (00:00:00) tomorrow
 * + Accepts special values "NaT" (not a time), "Today", (current
 *   day according to local time) and "Now" (current time in UTC).
 *
 * 'str' must be a NULL-terminated string, and 'len' must be its length.
 * 'unit' should contain -1 if the unit is unknown, or the unit
 *      which will be used if it is.
 * 'casting' controls how the detected unit from the string is allowed
 *           to be cast to the 'unit' parameter.
 *
 * 'out' gets filled with the parsed date-time.
 * 'out_local' gets set to 1 if the parsed time was in local time,
 *      to 0 otherwise. The values 'now' and 'today' don't get counted
 *      as local, and neither do UTC +/-#### timezone offsets, because
 *      they aren't using the computer's local timezone offset.
 * 'out_bestunit' gives a suggested unit based on the amount of
 *      resolution provided in the string, or -1 for NaT.
 * 'out_special' gets set to 1 if the parsed time was 'today',
 *      'now', or ''/'NaT'. For 'today', the unit recommended is
 *      'D', for 'now', the unit recommended is 's', and for 'NaT'
 *      the unit recommended is 'Y'.
 *
 * Returns 0 on success, -1 on failure.
